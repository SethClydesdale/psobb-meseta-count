#### Gaining and Losing Meseta
When you gain or lose Meseta it'll be shown next to the Meseta count. This display can be toggled on or off with the **Show Gains and Losses** config option. It is enabled by default.

### Extra Notes

#### Meseta Icon
The closest ASCII character that I found which almost looks like a Diamond (or Meseta) is ALT+7 : "`â€¢`", the bullet character. You can use this character as an alternative to the dollar sign in the Meseta Label configuration option, if you want something that closely resembles Meseta.

### Change Log

#### v1.3.1
- Added option to block window movement (special thanks to [raohmaru](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/psobb-meseta-count/pull/1) for adding this).

#### v1.3.0
- Added Gains and Losses indicator. For example : picking up 100 meseta will show +100, and buying an item worth 500 will show -500. This can be toggled in the configuration. You may need to increase the width of the Meseta Count window to about 180 if you're currently using this addon.
- Added **Show Placeholder** configuration option. This will let you turn the placeholder that shows when your Meseta isn't available on or off.

- Cleaned up and organized the configuration menu, added collapsible groups, tooltips, and made minor optimizations to some options.

- Fixed Font Scale affecting the title bar.

#### v1.2.0

- Added digit grouping configuration option to make reading the Meseta value easier. (100000 --> 100,000 when enabled)
